## Team Policy



1) As a student, I want each member of each group to provide meaningful commit messages, so that 
organization can be maintained through the groupâ€™s repository.
2) As a student, I want each group to be organized in terms of meeting sessions and material for 
their programs so that no one falls behind or loses important information.
3) As a student, I want each member of my group to get notified when someone completes an issue, 
so that everyone knows what still needs to be work on.
4) As a Student, I want each member of my group to rank each user story in terms of expected 
workload through a storypoint system, so that the group can collectively decide how to divide 
the work and better plan execution. 
5) As a student, I want every userstory that is apart of an active sprint to have the group member
 that is working on it assigned to it, so that if I have a question or concern about a user story 
I can see who it is assigned to in github.
6) As a student, I want to assign and record documentation of a user story so that we have clearly
 commented code that can be interpreted by anyone outside of the project.
7) Update Project Boards.
8) Communicate issues and problems with group.
9) Keep documentation up to date.
